# hi, im ish

im a business informatics student exploring the world of tech from multiple angles including data, backend development, cloud systems, and cybersecurity. im interested in how systems work, how they scale, and how they can be built to solve real problems.

this space is where i document, share, and build what i learn. hopefully my journey can be beneficial for others as well ^^

- Backend development and system design  
- Data pipelines, streaming, and real-time architectures  
- Databases, cloud infrastructure, and distributed systems  
- Security concepts and automation  
- Data science, analysis, and tools for decision-making  

## what im doing

- Learning by building and experimenting  
- Writing clear, practical code  
- Sharing templates, walkthroughs, and tools  
- Slowly contributing to open-source where i can  

## goals

- Build and share things that are useful to others  
- Keep improving and learning across different domains  
- Collaborate with developers, researchers, and engineers  
- Stay curious and open to where this path leads
